### Divide and Conquer
Dividing problems into sub problems till problems are unbaled to be divided, to minimize the problem, and start solving subproblems and after solutions, start merging the solved problems or we can say solutions, till they no more problems left, It was a real life scanner How Divide and Conquer works, In this we used multi dimensional array of size nxn, and applied nested loop 2 loops with variable i, j, and started iterating loops on keys (rows, columns) or array, denoted queen by 1, and 0 by blank, if we found 1 in diagonal right[i][j] = i-j+n-1.
